My high level idea with this is the following :

i want to create a chatgpt like interface where a user can open a chat and talk to a 3d avatar with voice. The use case I am targetting is in pretty much everything where you need to have a socratic discussion. For example, let's say you're iterating on a startup idea, the ability to debate on the idea would help massively. Or another use case, let's say you're a student who wants to debate the course material with discourse, you would have that ability. I want to design the UI in such a way that we're able to open the 3d avatar and start that discourse, and not have a filter. Just talk about anything and the AI will engage in conversation.

What do you think of this idea, I am thinking of adding some sort of tolerance parameter, where we can lower the filter and have it give you the raw truth, I'd like to know the technologies involved at a high level.

Thet tech stack i'd like to use is next.js + typescript + trpc (backend) + fastapi (other backend)
