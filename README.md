My high level idea with this is the following :

i want to create a chatgpt like interface where a user can open a chat and talk to a 3d avatar with voice. The use case I am targetting is in pretty much everything where you need to have a socratic discussion. For example, let's say you're iterating on a startup idea, the ability to debate on the idea would help massively. Or another use case, let's say you're a student who wants to debate the course material with discourse, you would have that ability. I want to design the UI in such a way that we're able to open the 3d avatar and start that discourse, and not have a filter. Just talk about anything and the AI will engage in conversation.

What do you think of this idea, I am thinking of adding some sort of tolerance parameter, where we can lower the filter and have it give you the raw truth, I'd like to know the technologies involved at a high level.

Thet tech stack i'd like to use is next.js + typescript + trpc (backend) + fastapi (other backend)


Your idea for a real-time conversational AI with a 3D avatar for Socratic discussion is feasible, and several existing technologies can be leveraged to build it. Here’s a high-level breakdown of the frameworks, tools, and considerations:

---

### **Core Technologies Needed**
#### **1. Voice Processing**
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):**  
  Use services like **Whisper** (open-source), **Google Speech-to-Text**[3], or **ElevenLabs**[7] for real-time transcription.  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  **ElevenLabs** (for natural voices) or **Google Text-to-Speech**[3] to generate the avatar’s voice.

#### **2. Conversational AI**
- **Large Language Model (LLM):**  
  Integrate **OpenAI GPT-4**, **PaLM API**[3], or self-hosted models like **OLAMA**[1] for unfiltered, debate-focused responses.  
  - Implement a "tolerance parameter" via **prompt engineering** (e.g., adjusting system prompts like *"Respond candidly, prioritize logical rigor over politeness"*).  

#### **3. 3D Avatar Animation**
- **Avatar Creation:**  
  Use **Blender**[1] or **ReadyPlayerMe**[7] to design the 3D model.  
- **Lip-Syncing & Expressions:**  
  Leverage **MediaPipe’s audio-to-blendshapes model**[3] or **three.js**[3][7] to sync lip movements with generated speech.  
- **Rendering Engine:**  
  **React Three Fiber** (for React/Next.js integration)[7] or **Unity** for advanced animations.

#### **4. Real-Time Communication**
- **Backend:**  
  Use **tRPC** (for Next.js API routes) and **FastAPI** (for async tasks like LLM inference or WebSocket streaming).  
- **WebSockets:**  
  Handle real-time audio/video streams between the frontend and backend.

#### **5. Frontend UI**
- **Next.js + TypeScript:**  
  Build the chat interface with a side-by-side view of the 3D avatar and conversation history[1][6].  
- **State Management:**  
  Use **Zustand** or **Jotai** for real-time updates to the avatar’s animations and chat log.

### **Existing Solutions to Borrow From**
- **Pipecat**[5]: An open-source framework for building real-time voice agents. It supports ElevenLabs, Whisper, and WebSocket streaming.  
- **Google’s Talking Character Template**[3]: Demonstrates integrating PaLM API with 3D avatars using MediaPipe and three.js.  
- **Dittin AI**[6]: A no-filter platform with 3D avatars and voice messaging (customizable via API).

### **Suggested Stack**
| Component          | Tools                                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**       | Next.js, React Three Fiber, Three.js, Zustand                                            |
| **Backend**        | tRPC (Next.js), FastAPI (Python for async LLM calls)                                     |
| **Voice**          | ElevenLabs (TTS), Whisper (STT)                                                          |
| **LLM**            | PaLM API (for structured debates) or self-hosted OLAMA/Mistral (for unfiltered responses) |
| **Avatar**         | ReadyPlayerMe (pre-built models) + MediaPipe/three.js for animation                      |
| **Real-Time**      | WebSockets, Pipecat framework[5]                                                        |

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Prototype the Chat UI:**  
   Build a Next.js interface with a chat history panel and placeholder avatar.  
2. **Integrate Voice:**  
   Add ElevenLabs TTS and Whisper STT with WebSocket streaming.  
3. **Connect LLM:**  
   Use FastAPI to route user input to the LLM and stream responses back.  
4. **Animate Avatar:**  
   Implement MediaPipe’s audio-to-blendshapes model[3] to sync lip movements with audio.  
5. **Add "Tolerance" Logic:**  
   Adjust LLM system prompts (e.g., *"Debate rigorously, avoid hedging phrases"*) and temperature settings.
